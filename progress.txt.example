## 2026-01-06 - Completed: Set up error logging

**Task ID:** task-004
**Plan:** plans/task-004-plan.md

**What was done:**
- Configured winston logger with multiple transports
- Added error middleware to Express app
- Created custom error classes for different error types

**Technical details:**
- Used winston@3.11.0 for logging
- Configured file transport for errors and combined logs
- Added express-async-errors for cleaner async error handling
- Created ErrorHandler middleware that catches all errors and formats responses

**Files created:**
- src/utils/logger.ts - Winston logger configuration
- src/middleware/errorHandler.ts - Centralized error handling middleware
- src/errors/AppError.ts - Base error class with status codes

**Files modified:**
- src/app.ts - Added error middleware to Express app
- package.json - Added winston and express-async-errors dependencies

**Deviations from plan:**
- Added express-async-errors library (not in original plan) to handle async errors more elegantly

**Next task recommendation:** Work on task-002 (Create user profile page) since task-001 (authentication) is now complete

## 2026-01-06 - Planned: Set up error logging

**Task ID:** task-004
**Plan:** plans/task-004-plan.md
**Rationale:** Selected this task because it's independent (no dependencies) and provides critical infrastructure for debugging. With authentication complete, having proper error logging will help as we build more features.

**NEXT: EXECUTE task-004**

## 2026-01-06 - Completed: Implement user authentication system

**Task ID:** task-001
**Plan:** plans/task-001-plan.md

**What was done:**
- Implemented JWT-based authentication
- Created registration and login endpoints
- Added password hashing with bcrypt
- Created auth middleware for protected routes

**Technical details:**
- Used bcrypt with 10 salt rounds for password hashing
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- Auth middleware extracts and verifies JWT from Authorization header
- Added proper TypeScript types for request extensions

**Files created:**
- src/utils/auth.ts - Auth utility functions (hashPassword, comparePassword, generateToken, verifyToken)
- src/middleware/auth.ts - JWT verification middleware
- src/routes/auth.ts - Authentication endpoints

**Files modified:**
- src/models/User.ts - Added password field and timestamps
- src/routes/index.ts - Registered auth routes
- .env.example - Added JWT_SECRET placeholder

**Deviations from plan:**
- None - followed plan exactly

**Next task recommendation:** Work on task-002 (Create user profile page) since it depends on task-001 which is now complete

=== END OF ENTRY ===

## 2026-01-06 - Planned: Implement user authentication system

**Task ID:** task-001
**Plan:** plans/task-001-plan.md
**Rationale:** Selected this as the first task because it's a foundational feature with no dependencies. Many other features (like user profile) depend on authentication being in place first.

**NEXT: EXECUTE task-001**
